          responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
          third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree
          that the Company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or
          indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by
          or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content,
          goods or services available on or through any such web sites or
          services. We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and

          immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
          whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and
          Conditions. Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease
          immediately. Limitation of Liability Notwithstanding any damages that
          You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
          suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy
          for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid
          by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased
          anything through the Service. To the maximum extent permitted by
          applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
          liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages
          whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of
          profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
          for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way
          related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party
          software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or
          otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the
          Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such
          damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some
          states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation
          of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that
          some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
          party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by
          law. "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer The Service is provided to
          You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without
          warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable
          law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates
          and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
          expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,
          statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all
          implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
          purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out
          of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
          Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty
          or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the
          Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
          compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or
          services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or
          reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects
          can or will be corrected. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the
          Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or
          warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or
          availability of the Service, or the information, content, and
          materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be
          uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or
          currency of any information or content provided through the Service;
          or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent
          from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan
          horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components. Some
          jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law. Governing Law The laws of the
          Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms
          and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be
          subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

          Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by
          contacting the Company. For European Union (EU) Users If You are a
          European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory
          provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident in.
          United States Legal Compliance You represent and warrant that (i) You
          are not located in a country that is subject to the United States
          government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States
          government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) You are not
          listed on any United States government list of prohibited or
          restricted parties. Severability and Waiver Severability If any
          provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such
          provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives
          of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law
          and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
          Waiver Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or
          to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not
          effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
          performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
          constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach. Translation

          original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute. Changes
